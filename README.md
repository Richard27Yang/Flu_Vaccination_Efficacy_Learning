Flu is almost around everywhere in 2018. 

Influenza (flu) is a mostly widely-spread contagious illness that occurs every season on everyone. Seasonal flu is a serious disease that causes illness, hospitalizations, and deaths every year in the United States. 
Influenza could lead to influenza-related death every year occur in people for whom seasonal influenza infection was likely a contributor to the cause of death. CDC estimates that from the 1976-1977 season to the 2006-2007 flu season, flu-associated deaths ranged from a low of about 3,000 to a high of about 49,000 people. 
While we all can get flu, people are more likely to experience severe flu illness, such as young children, adults aged 65 years and older, pregnant women, and people with certain chronic medical conditions.
