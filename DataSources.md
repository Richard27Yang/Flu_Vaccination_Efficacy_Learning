# Data sources
To accurately predict the effictivenss of the flu vaccine, data sources is required to be robust and reliable. In this proposal, the core data originates from the United States Center for Disease Control (CDC) FluView utility, which contains robust and standardized information gathered across each state across United States. Data is gathered from 2000 and keeps updates by week. 
Three different resources of data  is listed:

* CDC - A Weekly Influenza Surveillance Report Prepared by the Influenza Division, Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) Activity Level Indicator Determined by Data Reported to ILINet(https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/main.html)

* CDC BRFSS- Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data (https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/index.html)

* CDC - Pneumonia and Influenza Mortality Surveillance from the National Center for Health Statistics Mortality Surveillance System (https://gis.cdc.gov/grasp/fluview/mortality.html)
